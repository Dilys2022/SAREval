# SAREval
SAREval is the first dedicated benchmark for evaluating Visual Language Models (VLMs) on SAR image understanding. It targets the mismatch of existing remote sensing benchmarks with SAR’s unique mechanisms (scattering, polarization, distortion), focusing on 3 core capabilities: Perception, Reasoning, Robustness.
